\begin{abstract}
	This paper aims to seek reliability issues facing emergent Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technology utilizing Dedicated Short-Range Communication radios. These radios form Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) which are prone to issues unique to the highly-dynamic, low-latency, limited bandwidth environment wherein they operated. This paper discusses problems with congestion due to high traffic density, the hidden terminal problem, and the impact of high relative speeds. Then, it suggests what direction further research should focus on.

\section{Introduction and Background}
\label{sec:introduction}
	New wireless vehicular communication technology utilizing Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) allows for a host of new applications to make use of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication \cite{Kenney2011}. Benefits of DSRC communication include allowing for a reduction in traffic accidents, an increase in transportation efficiency, and the creation of a new a market for vehicular applications. To provide for these benefits, it is necessary to ensure that the technology is reliable at the wireless and application level. From a technical standpoint, the most important area of focus on DSRC reliability is on the behavior of DSRC wireless communications \cite{Bai2006}. DSRC radio behavior is a result of highly dynamic Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) created in proximity to vehicles and infrastructure. The unique nature of VANETs give rise to many reliability questions, such as traffic congestion \cite{Jabbarpour2014}. This paper will focus in on some notable reliability issues facing vehicular communication using DSRC and will suggest what means may be implemented to overcome them.

	Some of the topics to be explored include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems - Two wireless technologies: DSRC and 3G
		\item Distributed Congestion Control - ITS-G5 based on 802.11p; transmit \{rate,power,data rate\} control \cite{Uhlemann2015}
		\item Collisions \cite{Wenfeng2014}
	\end{enumerate}

	% TODO (Chris): Define and expand on these terms.
	A number of these topics are defined well in \cite{Serageldin2013}.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item VANET
		\item C-ITS
		\item Congestion vs Collisions (at least in this paper)
	\end{enumerate}
	
	% TODO (Chris): This paragraph is clunky and needs to be rewritten.
	Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) and Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) are specified in IEEE Std. 1609 and IEEE Std 802.11p respectively.  The IEEE Std. 1609.0-2010 describes the WAVE protocol stack using two planes, the management plane and the data plane \cite[p. 16]{IEEE2014-Std1609.0-2013}.  The data plane defines a shared set of physical (PHY), WAVE medium access control (MAC) and logical layer control (LLC) protocols as well a set of dual protocol stacks; the LLC and dual protocol stacks are defined in IEEE Std 1609.3 \cite[pp. 16--17]{IEEE2014-Std1609.0-2013}.  The first of the dual protocol stacks uses IPv6 and above layers (such as TCP and UDP) and the second of the stacks uses WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP) \cite[p. 9]{IEEE2010-Std1609.3-2010}.  Both of these protocol stacks accept data from higher layer protocols for transport using their respective protocols and also take data received and transmit it to higher network layers \cite[p. 9]{IEEE2010-Std1609.3-2010}.  Security features for WAVE are defined in IEEE Std. 1609.2 \cite{IEEE2013-Std1609.2-2013}.
	
	% TODO (Chris): Expand on DSRC more; we don't have access to ATSM ES2213, which seems to be the standard that defines DSRC
	The DSRC protocol refers specifically to communication between two WAVE devices \cite{Serageldin2013}.  That is to say, DSRC is the ``ad hoc part of WAVE \cite[p. 9]{Uhlemann2015}.''
	
	In \cref{sec:congestion}, issues stemming from congestion and congestion control are discussed. \Cref{sec:collision} discusses reliability issues caused by collision and collision control.  The paper ends with conclusions in \cref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Congestion Control}\label{sec:congestion}
	BSM generation rate should be maintained at maximum possible level so that reliability is guaranteed [or close to guaranteed] \cite{Wenfeng2014}.  Pourmohammadi investigates fairness using power control and range control and two algorithms that do this \cite{Pourmohammadi2015}.  Wenfeng mentions that Xu and Barth a rate control method is used \cite{Wenfeng2014,Xu2004-2}.  Kolte gives an overview of different congestion control algorithsm that have been proposed such as VeMAC, CCC-MAC and others as well as a proposed model for adaptive congestion control \cite{Kolte2014}.

	Controlling congestion is a significant issue facing DSRC. At high traffic densities, many researchers have noted congestion problems including packet collisions and longer delays between successful receipt of packets. These collisions and delays compromise the effects of safety applications \cite{Subramanian2012}.

	\subsection{Distributed Congestion Control}\label{sec:distributedcongestion}
		Uhlemann talks about distributed congestion control and that ETSI proposes this in ITS-G5\cite{Uhlemann2015}.  ETSI PHY and MAC layer document \cite{ETSI-ES202663} points to ETSI Technical Specification for Decentralized Congestion Control document (ETSI TS 102 687) for this\cite{ETSI-TS102687}.  Aygun et. al propose a transmit power control and rate control, specifically ECPR (Environment and Context Aware Combined Power and Rate) Distributed Congestion Control for Vehicular Communications\cite{Aygun2015}.

\section{Collision Control}\label{sec:collision}
	Here is where reliability issues caused by collision is detailed.


	\subsection{Hidden Terminals}\label{sec:hiddenterminal}
		During safety message transmission from one vehicle, other vehicles may move out of range of the sending vehicle, missing out on the safety information, thereby posing a threat to safety. Hidden terminals are vehicles that have moved out of this range, but still share the range with terminals in between them. Since safety messages use a single-hop, DSRC messages are particularly susceptible to this issue \cite{Ma2009}.
		
	\subsection{Bandwidth Coexistence}\label{sec:coexistence}
		Some of the sources to use here are \cite{Lansford2013,Chang2013,Toyota2013,NTIA2013}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
	Give a summary of the different things that were discussed in this paper.
