	abstract={Neighborhood discovery Link Layer service is provided by beaconing which denotes the process of periodically broadcasting status information. It allows vehicles to be aware of their surroundings. The availability of neighborhood knowledge guarantees accurate estimation of safety-related situations and helps to make strategic decisions based on assumed fresh information. Beacon messages share the same channel (Control Channel) as safety messages and are sent without any schedule; this may lead to severe contention and packet loss which can be dramatic for safety applications. The main goal of this work is to provide a method to synchronize beacons sending in a distributed manner, so that all nodes proceed to their sending within a beacon session which takes place in one control channel interval. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the method and provide a high level of accuracy and efficiency compared to the standard.},

	abstract={In this paper, we evaluate and improve the performance of the medium-access control (MAC) protocol for safety applications in a dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) environment. We first develop an analytical model to study the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) MAC protocol that has been adopted by the IEEE 802.11p standard for DSRC. Explicit expressions are derived for the mean and standard deviation of the packet delay, as well as for the packet delivery ratio (PDR) at the MAC layer in an unsaturated network formed by moving vehicles on a highway. The proposed model is validated using extensive simulations, and its superior accuracy is compared with that of other existing models is demonstrated. Insights gained from our model reveal that the principal reason for the low PDR of the DCF protocol is packet collision due to transmissions from hidden terminals. We then present a novel protocol based on the DCF that uses an out-of-band busy tone as a negative acknowledgment to provide an efficient solution to the aforementioned problem. We extend our analytical model to the enhanced protocol and show that it preserves predictive accuracy. Most importantly, our numerical experiments confirm that the enhanced protocol improves the PDR by up to 10% and increases the supported vehicle density by up to two times for a range of packet arrival rates while maintaining the delay below the required threshold level.},

	abstract={The DSRC/WAVE system is standardized to disseminate safety critical information using IEEE 802.11p as a MAC protocol. Studies show that IEEE 802.11p does not address adverse effects of asymmetric radio link and mobility related problems in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. This paper presents a cross-layer (i.e. MAC and network) algorithm to address these problems for making the V2V and V2I communications efficient and reliable. The analysis shows that the proposed cross-layer algorithm removes contention in channel accessing and confirms a better channel utilization. The solution can be used to disseminate information up to three hops without using a routing protocol. This is particularly important for extending range of safety critical and emergency related messages in the vehicular network.},

	abstract={The need of a medium access control (MAC) protocol for an efficient broadcast service is of great importance to support the high-priority safety applications in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This paper introduces VeMAC, a novel multichannel TDMA MAC protocol proposed specifically for a VANET scenario. The VeMAC supports efficient one-hop and multihop broadcast services on the control channel by using implicit acknowledgments and eliminating the hidden terminal problem. The protocol reduces transmission collisions due to node mobility on the control channel by assigning disjoint sets of time slots to vehicles moving in opposite directions and to road side units. Analysis and simulation results in highway and city scenarios are presented to evaluate the performance of VeMAC and compare it with ADHOC MAC, an existing TDMA MAC protocol for VANETs. It is shown that, due to its ability to decrease the rate of transmission collisions, the VeMAC protocol can provide significantly higher throughput on the control channel than ADHOC MAC.},

Many congestion control algorithms have been proposed to control congestion problem, still appropriate solution has not been found. For this purpose various algorithms have been proposed but at the expense of beacons which is equally important in the vehicular communication network. In this paper, an adaptive congestion control algorithm has been proposed, which is a time slot based mechanism that address beacons and emergency messages. With the help of this proposed algorithm and the coordinator selection, emergency messages can be delivered to its intended recipients without any delay and that to without the expense of beacons.},

	abstract={Cooperative vehicle safety (CVS) systems operate based on frequent broadcast of vehicle state (e.g., position, heading and speed) and safety information to other vehicles over a wireless local area network. Such networks are formed using Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. In crowded networks the shared wireless channel may become congested and fail to deliver the broadcast information, potentially affecting the reliability of CVS applications. This issue, known as scalability issue, has been identified as one of the challenges to be addressed with high scale deployment of vehicle safety networks. Several scalability algorithms have recently been introduced and studied in literature; currently a select number of algorithms are under study by industry for possible adoption and standardization. One method used by some algorithms is congestion control through power or range adaptation. In this paper, we analyze two existing range control algorithms in terms of time stability and spatial fairness. We derive stability conditions for the main range control scheme that is currently under study. An improved algorithm that relaxes these conditions is then proposed and its convergence properties are studied in detail. We show that the algorithm is stable and can be controlled to quickly converge to desired operation points. Finally, fairness properties of several power control schemes are studied and an enhancement method is presented that ensures spatial fairness is achieved by the presented power control schemes.},

The reliability related QoS metrics in both the MAC-level and the Application-level including packet reception ratio, T-window reliability, and awareness probability are derived. Inspired by the correlation between road traffic and vehicle speed revealed by Greenshields model, we observe that the current reliability related QoS requirements for safety applications are set without considering change of road traffic. Based on the observation, a new reliability requirement setting is proposed to tune tolerance time for various safety applications with different road traffic. The QoS requirements for the three typical safety applications that are believed to have the most stringent QoS requirements are specified and discussed. Taking velocity, density and time into account, application-level reliability metrics are improved for high vehicle density. From the results obtained under worst case with different vehicle density, we can observe the feasibility of our proposed reliability requirement setting.},

abstract={The term connected vehicles refers to applications, services, and technologies that connect a vehicle to its surroundings. Adopting a definition similar to that of AUTO Connected Car News, a connected vehicle is basically the presence of devices in a vehicle that connect to other devices within the same vehicle and/or devices, networks, applications, and services outside the vehicle. Applications include everything from traffic safety and efficiency, infotainment, parking assistance, roadside assistance, remote diagnostics, and telematics to autonomous self-driving vehicles and global positioning systems (GPS). Typically, vehicles that include interactive advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) and cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) can be regarded as connected. Connected-vehicle safety applications are designed to increase situation awareness and mitigate traffic accidents through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. ADAS technology can be based on vision/camera systems, sensor technology, vehicle data networks, V2V, or V2I systems. Features may include adaptive cruise control, automate braking, incorporate GPS and traffic warnings, connect to smartphones, alert the driver to hazards, and keep the driver aware of what is in the blind spot. V2V communication technology could mitigate traffic collisions and improve traffic congestion by exchanging basic safety information such as location, speed, and direction between vehicles within range of each other. It can supplement active safety features, such as forward collision warning and blind-spot detection.},

This proposal, which would create a new set of rules for the band that would become U-NII-4, requires the unlicensed devices to recognize the existence of DSRC systems and defer to them, since DSRC would remain as a co-primary user of the band. This paper examines the issues surrounding U-NII-4 band sharing, reports on industry activities that are trying to balance the needs of the market segments that intend to use the band, discusses some initial ideas for how band sharing could work that adequately protect DSRC, and looks at future work that needs to be done that will adequately inform regulators about the feasibility and practicality of sharing the 5.9 GHz ITS band.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces VeMAC, a novel multichannel TDMA MAC protocol designed specifically for a vehicular ad hoc network. The network has one control channel and multiple service channels. On the control channel nodes acquire time slots in a distributed way, while on the service channels nodes are assigned time slots in a centralized manner. VeMAC decreases the probability of transmission collisions caused by node mobility by assigning disjoint sets of time slots to vehicles moving in opposite directions and to road side units. Analysis and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of VeMAC and compare it to ADHOC MAC, an existing MAC protocol based on TDMA. It is shown that, for the same number of contending nodes and available time slots, nodes can acquire time slots on the control channel much faster in VeMAC than in ADHOC MAC, when the number of available time slots is sufficiently larger than the number of contending nodes.},

	Abstract = {Compared with the CSMA based MAC protocols, the slotted reservation solutions could be more adaptable for VANETs. However, the high mobility and mobile hidden terminal (MHT) issues in vehicular environments cause a challenge of efficient and scalable slotted scheduling for TDMA MAC protocols. This paper proposes a novel near collision free reservation (CFR) MAC which is based on a recent VeMAC protocol to provide near collision free scheduling and address the mobile hidden terminal issue in VANETs. In former distributed TDMA MAC proposals like VeMAC, on the control channel of DSRC communication system, each vehicle randomly reserves dedicated time slots. However, the slot reservation of CFR MAC is more structural, based on the driving status and traffic flow of each vehicle. The performance of CFR MAC is verified via simulations and comparisons with IEEE 802.11p and VeMAC to demonstrate that superiority of CFR MAC.},

	Abstract = {A promising new class of wireless networks has recently emerged, the so-called Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). WMNs inherit many advantages from both wired infrastructure and also ad-hoc networks. However, in spite of their distinct characteristics, they also face many technical problems that were present in older classes of wireless networks, such as wireless LANs or pure ad-hoc networks. The much discussed hidden terminal problem is one of them. We argue that an accurate analysis of the effect of hidden nodes in the performance of a random access protocol is still an open issue. In this paper we show the problems and the limitations stemming from common assumptions used in the literature and propose a novel method of modeling time that uses a fixed size channel slot as the unit of time in order to take into account the desynchronisation of nodes. Finally we apply our general method to the classic hidden terminal problem incorporating an iterative step. The proposed analytical model is shown to have a very good match to simulation results for an IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol.},

	Abstract = {Wireless vehicular communication has the potential to enable a host of new applications, the most important of which are a class of safety applications that can prevent collisions and save thousands of lives. The automotive industry is working to develop the dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology, for use in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communication. The effectiveness of this technology is highly dependent on cooperative standards for interoperability. This paper explains the content and status of the DSRC standards being developed for deployment in the United States. Included in the discussion are the IEEE 802.11p amendment for wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), the IEEE 1609.2, 1609.3, and 1609.4 standards for Security, Network Services and Multi-Channel Operation, the SAE J2735 Message Set Dictionary, and the emerging SAE J2945.1 Communication Minimum Performance Requirements standard. The paper shows how these standards fit together to provide a comprehensive solution for DSRC. Most of the key standards are either recently published or expected to be completed in the coming year. A reader will gain a thorough understanding of DSRC technology for vehicular communication, including insights into why specific technical solutions are being adopted, and key challenges remaining for successful DSRC deployment. The U.S. Department of Transportation is planning to decide in 2013 whether to require DSRC equipment in new vehicles.},

The allocation of 75 MHz in the 5.9 GHz band for dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) may also enable future delivery of rich media content to vehicles at short to medium ranges via vehicle-to-roadside (v2e) links. Recently, AASTM committee E17.51 endorsed a variant of the IEEE wireless LAN standard, denoted 802.11a roadside applications (R/A), as the platform for the DSRC link and data link layer. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview of DSRC applications and assess IEEE802.11 PHY and MAC layer characteristics in this context. It is anticipated that current 802.11 specifications need to be suitably altered to meet requirements for DSRC environments of multihop connectivity, high vehicle mobility, and heterogeneous services with a variety of QoS requirements for which the original design was not intended. This article captures the current state of the art of 802.11-based multiple access protocols and highlights open research issues.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper presents -- Passive Cooperative Collision Warning (PCCW), and enhanced-PCCW (EPCCW) protocol designs for safety message reception reliability improvement in Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC). PCCW and EPCCW employ a cooperative warning scheme for reduction of collisions, without increasing packet traffic. EPCCW utilizes the physical layer (PHY) properties to create sub-slots for the purpose of further increasing reliability by both avoiding and minimizing probability of collision at slots that would nominally fail. Full analytical derivation of the relative reliability and delay performances for both PCCW and EPCCW protocols is provided. An accurate and complete simulation model is used, which combines an accurate DSRC PHY, MAC and federated mobility model designed using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) model. Analytical and simulation results agree and show that PCCW and EPCCW protocols significantly improve reliability performance relative to the leading safety messaging protocols. Under high collision scenarios and at optimal number of repetitions, an improvement of up to 40% in reliability is observed, and up to 80% of improvement is achieved at higher load. Improvement in average timeslots delay is also observed that is well within acceptable delay threshold. Thorough simulation results of the proposed protocols are presented under varying message range, coding rates, modulation schemes, channel models, vehicular densities, safety message lifetimes, and transmission frequencies.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses mobile hidden station (MHS) problem which is a significant source of packet collisions in medium access control (MAC) protocols of vehicular networks due to relatively high node speeds. MHS problem occurs when mobile stations that are not present in the channel reservation period enter and disturb the existing communications. We present effect of MHS problem using Markov model of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). Then we present how MHS affects the repetition broadcast protocols using analytical analysis results. Finally, protocols that mitigate effect of MHS at MAC layer for both infotaintment communication and safety broadcast messaging are presented. MAC protocol for infotaintment is Enhanced Sliding Frame Reservation Aloha (ESFRA) and for safety broadcast messaging is Passive Cooperative Collision Warning (PCCW). With these protocols, it is verified that effect of MHS is significantly reduced, which result in lower delay and significant improvement in reliability. Both analytical analysis and simulation results agree.},

	Abstract = {The Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technology has been adopted by the IEEE community to enable safety and non-safety application for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). To better serve these two classes of applications, the DSRC standard divides the bandwidth into seven channels. One channel, called control channel (CCH) to serve safety applications and the other six channels, called service channels (SCHs) to serve non-safety applications. The DSRC standard specifies a channel switching scheme to allow vehicles to alternate between these two classes of application. The standard also recommends that vehicles should visit the CCH every 100ms, called Synchronization Interval (SI), to send and receive their status messages. It is highly desirable that these status messages be delivered to the neighbouring vehicles reliably and within an acceptable delay bound. It is obvious that increasing the time share of the CCH from the SI will increase the reliability of safety applications. In this paper, we will optimize the control channel access such that safety applications have a high successful transmission rate within their share of the SI interval. Moreover, a new algorithm, called Optimal Channel Access (OCA), will be introduced to enhance the performance of the DSRC while keeping the CCH I as small as possible. Hence non-safety applications will have a fair share of the DSRC bandwidth.},

	Abstract = {The 802.11-p based dedicated short range communication (DSRC) is being seriously considered as a promising wireless technology for enhancing transportation safety and highway efficiency. However, to-date, there is very little research done in characterizing the reliability of DSRC communication based on real-world experimental data, and its effect on the reliability of vehicle safety applications. Our experimental set-up includes a fleet of three vehicles equipped with DSRC communication system, GPS receiver and a number of vehicle safety applications based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication. This paper analyzes the link-level behavior of DSRC vehicle-to-vehicle communication in a wide variety of traffic environments based on real-world experimental data. In addition, we also characterize the application level reliability of DSRC for vehicle safety communication (VSC) system. Based on our experiments, we show that the reliability of DSRC vehicle-to-vehicle communication is adequate since packet drops do not occur in bursts most of the time. We also show that the application level reliability of VSC applications based on DSRC communication is quite satisfactory. Finally, we develop an analytical model to relate application level reliability with communication reliability and VSC system parameter, laying out a clear way to improve reliability of VSC applications under harsh traffic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to characterize the application-level reliability of DSRC communication for VSC applications based on real-world experimental data. Our findings develop a deep insight into significant characteristics of DSRC communication for highly mobile vehicle-to-vehicle wireless network, which will contribute to better design and evaluation of communication protocols for VSC applications in the future},

	Abstract = {This research addresses reliability issues of safety applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that use Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) in Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) systems. Reliability of such applications is affected not only by the usual environmental effects of wireless communication, but also potentially by malicious act. The case of constant and random jamming and their impact on safety applications are investigated under consideration of the data rates used. It is shown that the most important message, the Basic Safety Message (BSM), which is transmitted on a dedicated safety channel can be jammed, resulting in safety application failure. To mitigate against jamming a communication scheme based on redundant channel is used that utilizes channels with higher power ratings for communicating data with BSM-equivalent content, while not deviating from existing standards. The impact of channel and message redundancy for different data rates is investigated. Considering the two jammer types, it is shown that the introduction of redundancy overcomes the impact of jamming attacks. Furthermore it is demonstrated that application reliability increases inverse to the data rates of the channels. Analysis shows that DSRC safety applications that use redundant communication can overcome jamming attacks if data rates of 3Mbps and 6Mbps are used, while 12Mbps communication is not advisable.},

Broadcasting of safety messages is one of the fundamental services in DSRC. There have been numerous publications addressing design and analysis of such broadcast ad hoc system based on the simulations. For the first time, an analytical model is proposed in this paper to evaluate performance and reliability of IEEE 802.11a-based vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety-related broadcast services in DSRC system on highway. The proposed model takes two safety services with different priorities, nonsaturated message arrival, hidden terminal problem, fading transmission channel, transmission range, IEEE 802.11 backoff counter process, and highly mobile vehicles on highway into account. Based on the solutions to the proposed analytic model, closed-form expressions of channel throughput, transmission delay, and packet reception rates are derived.

	Abstract = {We study the wireless communication among highway vehicles in the newly-assigned 5.9 GHz dedicated short range communication (DSRC) spectrum. A vehicle-vehicle location-based broadcast (LBB) communication protocol is designed to meet highway safety applications' communication requirements. The analytical expressions of the performance of the protocol in terms of probability of transmission failure and channel occupancy are derived with commonly satisfied assumptions. The optimal relation between the performance and design parameters is obtained from the expressions. The sensitivity of the protocol performance is tested for various communication conditions as well as highway traffic conditions. Feasible combinations of the communication and highway traffic parameters are found for certain requirements on protocol performance.},

	Abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are considered one of the most critical infrastructures. For wireless communication ITS use communication links based on Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) in Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) systems, which is a promising technology to improve traffic safety and reduce highway fatalities. Much research has focused on supporting WAVE safety applications, which depend on many message types. The most important message related to safety applications is the Basic Safety Message (BSM), as defined in the SAE J2735 Message Set Dictionary Standard. Thus, this paper focuses on the reliability of safety applications in the presence of jamming attacks affecting BSM. The case of a constant jammer is considered under the assumption that its capabilities are limited to the technical specifications of the vehicles On-Board Unit (OBU), a device that is readily available for purchase. A communications architecture for safety applications is defined that considers dissimilarity and redundancy to overcome the effects of jamming. The dual and triple-redundant schemes presented enable channels with higher power ratings to communicate the needed BSM data to safety applications. This is accomplished without making any assumptions deviating from the existing standards. Using the Forward Collision Warning safety application, it is shown that the redundancy schemes can effectively overcome the impact of jamming. Furthermore, it is shown that the use of 12 Mbps communication speed is not advisable under the adversary model.},

	Abstract = {Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) is the wireless communication protocol of safety applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) using Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANET). Due to the criticality of the ITS the reliability of its safety applications is of great concern. Much research has been dedicated to reliable message exchange in VANET, mainly focusing on the physical and Media Access Control (MAC) layers. In contrast, our research considers reliability from the safety application point of view, as it is adversely affected by malicious behavior, thus shedding light on application layer reliability. Specifically, the wireless communication shared medium can be used by jammers to launch Wireless Denial of Service (WDoS) attacks. This has great implications for Basic Safety Message (BSM), which is the most important message for safety applications as defined in the SAE J2735 Message Set Dictionary Standard. In this paper we study the impact of different jamming types, constant, random, and intelligent, on the reliability of BSM message exchanges. For the research we selected the Forward Collision Warning (FCW), which is one of the identified critical safety applications by the standard. We introduce survivability mechanisms, utilizing the concept of dissimilarity and redundancy, to increase reliability of the application. These mechanisms are strictly compliant with existing standards, and thus do not require any mechanisms outside of the standards. The impact of the different jamming types and the effectiveness of our solutions on the application reliability are demonstrated.},
